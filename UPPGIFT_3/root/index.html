    <h1>HEJ HEJ</h1>
    <p3>The SR20DET is part of the SR family of engines from Nissan.

        It is a popular inline four-cylinder engine fitted into a variety of cars, generally the Nissan Silvia and 180SX. It also came in the Pulsar GTI-R, 
        Nissan NX Coupe and the Nissan Bluebird. This engine replaced the CA18DE and CA18DET that originally powered the Silvia and 180SX. 
        The CA18 was deemed too expensive to produce and no longer met Japanese emission standards, 
        so it was replaced by the SR20. The SR, just like the out-going CA,
         was a turbocharged intercooled engine in top form. Nissan also produced a cheaper naturally aspirated version called the SR20DE. </p3>
